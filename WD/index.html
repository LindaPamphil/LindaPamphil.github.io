				<h1>K-Pop Generations</h1>


				<p>K-pop is a music genre which originated in South Korea. The genre includes different sub genres of bubble pop, electronic dance, hip hop, pop, r&b, rock, jazz, etc. There are different eras of k-pop usually called generations or ‘gen’. They first began in the 1990s and continue to this day. They have tons of western influence to the point that many people argue that it's basically the same.</p>

		<h2 style="font-size: 25px;">Audition and Trainees system</h2>

			<p>Many aspiring people, typically ranging from ages 10 to 17, audition for various K-pop companies in hopes of securing a spot as a trainee. Once accepted, these trainees go through rigorous training to enhance their vocal and dance skills. Some also take additional classes, such as language courses to improve Korean pronunciation for foreign idols, as well as lessons on etiquette, attitude, and media handling.</p>

			<p>During this period, trainees often reside together in cramped dormitories, where they train every day in pursuit of self-improvement. This demanding schedule sometimes leads trainees to make the difficult decision to drop out of school at a young age, prioritizing their future careers in K-pop.</p>

			<p>However, even with years of training, there's no guarantee of debuting as an idol. Some trainees spend over a decade working on their skills within the same company before earning the opportunity to debut on stage. And even then, success and maintaining popularity as a group are not assured outcomes.</p><hr>

			<p>	
				Title: Kpop Generations
				<br>Semester/Year: Spring 2024

				<br>Coding language/software: Sublime Text (HTML/CSS)

				<br>Description: My adventure idea during this project was to create a timeline of all the progression throughout Kpop history. I wanted have made it extreamly long and detailed but, I choose to make it short because this project is mainly about coding instead of the text. I got very intrested in learning more about it, and I succeeded but it became challenging when I was trying to figure out what's considered good and back practice within HTML.
