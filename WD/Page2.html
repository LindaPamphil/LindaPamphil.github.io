			<h1>1st Generation</h1>
			<h2>(Early 1990s-Early 2000s)</h2>

		</div>

				<p>The 1st generation of K-pop drew heavy inspiration from early 90s music trends in the United States, particularly in hip hop, rap, pop, and R&B genres. Despite this influence, their music also conveyed messages of rebellion and love, creating a unique blend of sounds and themes. It was common for 1st generation K-pop groups to release full albums with over 10 songs, accompanied by longer promotional periods.</p><br>

				<p>The first group in this era was Seo Taiji and Boys, who debuted in 1992. They experimented with rap, techno, and rock elements, heavily influenced by Western 90s music trends. Following their success, other influential groups like H.O.T, S.E.S, Sech Skies, and BoA emerged, shaping the landscape of the Korean music industry in the 90s.</p>

				<p>As the early 2000s approached, K-pop began to go beyond the South Korean borders, making its mark in Asian countries such as Japan and China. In the absence of widespread internet access, communication within the 1st generation K-pop community relied on traditional methods such as fan letters, television appearances, newspapers, and magazines. These channels played a crucial role in fostering fan engagement and spreading awareness of K-pop beyond South Korea's borders.</p>
