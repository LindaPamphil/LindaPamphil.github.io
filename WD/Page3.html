			<p>During the 2nd generation of K-pop, the genre expanded its reach beyond South Korea, gaining attention in other Asian countries and beyond. Iconic groups like Wonder Girls, Shinee, Super Junior, Girls Generation, 2NE1, and Big Bang emerged, solidifying their status within the industry.</p><br>

			<br><p>Songs during this era leaned towards catchier melodies over deep lyrics, with simpler dance moves. Electronic sounds and rap became more mainstream, and there was a shift towards more frequent releases with shorter promotional periods. The rise of platforms like YouTube and social media led to groups creating and releasing English, Japanese, and sometimes Chinese versions of their songs, further boosting their popularity. Concerts started popping up in new areas, reflecting the genre's growing global appeal. Additionally, each group began to establish official fandom names, fostering a sense of community among fans.</p>

			<p>It then came to a memorable close with Psy's smash hit "Gangnam Style," which marked the end of the Golden Age and the beginning of the 3rd generation. Its viral success introduced K-pop to people worldwide, setting the stage for the genre's continued expansion and evolution.</p>
