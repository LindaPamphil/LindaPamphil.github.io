			<p>We're currently in the 4th generation of K-pop, which kicked off around 2018 and is still going strong. The earlier big-name groups from this generation debuted in 2019, while the freshest ones hit the scene around mid to late 2022.</p>

			<p>In this era, fans still have that close connection with their favorite idols, much like in the previous generation. However, now idols are taking charge of their own content creation. They're either making their own apps or jumping on platforms like TikTok to connect directly with fans.</p>

			<p>Musically, it's a mixed bag. Many songs blend different genres into one, creating a unique sound. Unlike earlier generations, where vocals often took center stage, this one is more about the performance.</p>

			<p>When it comes to releases, full albums aren't as common. Instead, you'll see a lot of EPs and singles being promoted for a few weeks before the artists move on to the next one, usually dropping another song every 2-3 months.</p>
