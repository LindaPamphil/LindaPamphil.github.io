        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This short project is a display of my life over the past two weeks on weekdays. I documented everything I did and saw, keeping the entries short and brief. To create the web page, I used Sublime Text for writing the HTML and CSS. I used Audacity to record some music to add background ambiance and Photoshop to design a little banner for the top of the page.</p>

        <p>I created multiple pages, each separated by dates, and included snippets of the moon phases for each day. This project captures the essence of my daily routine and experiences in a simple and organized manner, making use of various tools to enhance the presentation and provide a more immersive experience.</p><br><br>
