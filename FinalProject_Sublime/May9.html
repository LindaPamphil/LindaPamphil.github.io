        <h1>Thursday, May 9th 2024</h1>
       
			<p>On a Waxing Crescent with 3% visibility, I slept early and that ended up being good. I felt happy and content but tired. I just watched shows on my laptop and played a few games.</p>

			<p>My social battery was very withdrawn. I was physically productive when I volunteered at the school. It was sunny outside, with temperatures around 60 degrees, but it felt like it was 80.</p>
