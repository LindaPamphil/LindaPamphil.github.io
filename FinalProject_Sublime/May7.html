        <h1>Tuesday, May 7th 2024</h1>
       
			<p>It was a new moon, and I slept late and terribly. I was tired, stressed, sad, in constant pain, and angry almost all day. </p>

			<p>I mainly watched movies, didn't eat, wasn't productive, and didn't want to talk to anyone.</p> 

			<p>But, it was sunny outside all day with temperatures around 54 degrees and a Waning Crescent at 1% visibility.</p>
