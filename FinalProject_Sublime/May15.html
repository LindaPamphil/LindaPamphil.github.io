        <h1>Wednesday, May 15th 2024</h1>
       
		<p>Today was a tiring day. I woke up, and it was cold as fuck, it was drizzling, and I was tired. I went to school to do some volunteer work for my CCT and spent 5 hours in theater 1, helping people with their cap and gown registration. </p>

		<p>It was long and tiring, but I had a lot of interesting conversations and made a few friends. Then I went to the gym, spent 2 hours there until it closed. My legs were burning the whole time I went home and that whole night. </p>

		<p>My body was tired, I ate a bunch of food and passed out, then woke up and slept at 4am. The moon was First Quarter at 50%.</p>
