        <h1>Thursday, May 16th 2024</h1>
       
		<p>After yesterday, I woke up at 12:30 and stayed in my bed until 4pm. It looked cold and drizzly outside, so I was wondering if I should go to the gym or not, but in the end I did.</p>

		<p>Came back, got some work done, ate some food and went to sleep. It was pretty much a lazy day. And It was around 63 degrees with a Waxing Crescent moon with 59%.</p>
