        <h1>Monday, May 13th 2024</h1>
       
         <p>Today I woke up around 8:30-9ish. I had a kind of terrible sleep because I went to sleep at 2 am and woke up around 4 am, and then I went back to sleep, so I was a bit groggy. </p>

		<p>I was thinking about getting a coffee, but I didn't because I wanted to stop that habit. So I just went to school for some volunteer work, talked to a few friends, and then went to the school gym with one of them.</p>

		<p>The weather was very cold this morning, but it went down a little. Still cold though. I was very productive, happy and tired. </p>

		<p>So around 50 to 60 degrees and cloudy with a 31% Waxing Crescent moon.</p>
