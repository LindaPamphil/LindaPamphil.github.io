        <h1>Tuesday, May 14th 2024</h1>
       
         <p>Today went well. I went to the gym yesterday, so my soreness made my night go smoothly. I had a good night's sleep. I didn't randomly wake up in the middle of the night like I usually do.</p>

		<p>It was cold this morning, but It looked sunny outside, about 87 degrees ish.</p>

		<p>But when I went outside, it was hot as fuck. Then after I went to class, I took a lil walk outside by the river and then went home.</p>

		<p>I didn't go to the gym because I was sore. I did one of my finals, work study work and then one of my other assignments from my other class. Todayâ€™s moon is a 40% Waxing Crescent.</p>
