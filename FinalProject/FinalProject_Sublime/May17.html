        <h1>Friday, May 17th 2024</h1>
       
			<p>I woke up around 9 a.m. as usual and had some pancakes for breakfast. Afterward, I spent about 2 hours at the gym, followed by a refreshing shower. </p>

			<p>Later in the day, I met up with my friend, and we spent the entire day together. Although I had plans to volunteer, I ended up choosing to hang out with my friend instead. </p>

			<p>Afterwards, we grabbed some food, specifically Popeyes, before heading home. By the end of the day, I was absolutely exhausted from the gym session and all the walking.</p>
