        <h1>Wednesday, May 8th 2024</h1>
       
			<p>On a Waxing Crescent with 0% visibility, I slept early and well. Despite feeling ok, I was tired and had body pains.</p>

			<p>I stayed home and watched a bunch of movies, but I didn't eat at all. I volunteered at school. The weather was hot and sunny, with temperatures over 60 degrees.</p>
