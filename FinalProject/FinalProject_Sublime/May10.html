        <h1>Friday, May 10th 2024</h1>
       
			<p>On a Waxing Crescent with 7% visibility, I slept late and had an okay rest. I felt happy, relaxed, content, and energetic. I just watched TV shows, cause my social battery was god awful. I didn't wanna talk to anyone or do anything.</p>

			<p>But I was a lil productive with school work. The weather was cloudy, rainy, and windy with temperatures around 50 degrees, so I just stayed home all day.</p>
